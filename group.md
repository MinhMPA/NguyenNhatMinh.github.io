Below are some group photos and descriptions of the groups I have been a member of over the years...

### The cosmology group @ Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics,  
### Physics Department, University of Michigan

Our big group consists of members from Prof. Huterer's, Prof. Evrard, Prof. Avestruz, and Prof. Soares-Santos's research groups. As observed in the photos, we are an ever growing international group of researchers and are reaching the critical mass. I have been working towards bringing our people together through group/journal club meetings and social coffee!

### The physical cosmology group @ Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Garching

<p>This group felt like they are my extended family. The group includes Prof. Eiichiro Komatsu's, Fabian Schmidt's, and Prof. Sherry Suyu's independent groups. Eiichiro managed to put together a group of people who are not only awesomely stellar researchers but also awfully kind colleagues and friends. I almost did not want to ever leave the group.</p>

<p>I organized the MPA-MPE journal club and the MPA cosmology book club. We are still proud that we finished Binney-Tremaine's <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987gady.book.....B/abstract">Galactic Dynamics</a> (which I would only recommend as a reference)!
