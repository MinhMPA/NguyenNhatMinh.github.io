<p> A summary of my academic background can be found in my <a href="https://minhmpa.github.io/academic-cv/">CV</a>. Below and in other tabs, you will find more elaborated details that are hopefully useful. </p>
<p> I model and combine different probes of large-scale structure in our Universe to gain insights into gravity, Dark Energy, and structure formation. I conduct my research in collaboration with Prof. Dragan Huterer's <a href="http://websites.umich.edu/~huterer/mygroup.html">group</a> at the Physics Department, University of Michigan - <br /> where I work as a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/people/postdoctoral-fellows/nguyenmn.html">Leinweber Research Fellow</a>. </p>
<p> I enjoy collaboration as much as research. I am a member of the MPA <a href="https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/leftfield/release/leftfield">LEFTfield group</a>, the <a href="https://aquila-consortium.org/">Aquila consortium</a> and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration.</p>
<p> I love doing public outreach and have, for example, participated in the <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/">"Skype a Scientist"</a> program. I firmly believe in science popularization as a mean to improve diversity and inclusivity in science. In 2021, I inititaed and have since been organizing the (virtual) <a href="https://vllt-joint-seminar-series.github.io/2022/">VLLT Joint Seminar Series on Physics & Astrophysics</a>, geared towards students in Vietnam. I describe these activities further in <a href="{{ "/social" | absolute_url }}">SOCIAL</a>.</p>

                <p>I was a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA) in Garching, Germany. There I have worked with <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~fabians/">Fabian Schmidt</a> on <a href="https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/26235/">Bayesian forward modeling of galaxy clustering</a> and its application to cosmological or astrophysical inference.
		<p>I obtained my PhD through the <a href="https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/">IMPRS-astro program</a>, a partnership between the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen and astro institutes around Munich, in July 2020 amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  We had to wait a few months to celebrate my graduation (hence the distance between people in the above picture). I stayed in Munich for another year and a half to wait for the pandemic to calm down and also to resolve some visa issues.</p>
		<p>Before MPA and Munich, from 2014 to 2016, I was an <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/">AstroMundus</a> master student studying in Innsbruck, Rome and G&ouml;ttingen. I wrote my Master thesis with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thorstenbattefeld/">Thorsten Battefeld</a> on stabilizing numerical construction of the inflaton potential in multifield inflationary models.</p>
		<p>Even before that, I completed my bachelor in Physics, specializing in Theoretical Physics, at the University of Science, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh city. My thesis considered a scenario of neutrinos with dynamically varying mass in order to explain Dark Energy equation of state.</p>
