<p> A summary of my education and research can be found in my <a href="https://minhmpa.github.io/academic-cv/">CV</a>. Below and in other tabs, you will find elaborate information that are hopefully useful. </p>
<p> I model and combine different probes of large-scale structure in our Universe to gain insights into gravity, Dark Energy, and structure formation.
<!--I conduct my research in collaboration with Prof. Dragan Huterer's <a href="http://websites.umich.edu/~huterer/mygroup.html">group</a> at the Physics Department, University of Michigan - <br /> where I work as a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/people/postdoctoral-fellows/nguyenmn.html">Leinweber Research Fellow</a>. </p>-->
<!--<p> I enjoy collaboration as much as research. I am a member of the <a href="https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/leftfield/release/leftfield">LEFTfield group</a>, the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration</a>, <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/cosmology-x-data-science/simulation-based-inference-of-galaxies-simbig/">SIMBIG team</a>, and the <a href="https://www.aquila-consortium.org/">Aquila consortium</a>.</p>-->
<!--<p> I love doing public outreach and have, for example, participated in the <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/">"Skype a Scientist"</a>, <a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/physiciststogo.cfm">APS' Physicists To-Go</a> and UM's <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/u-m-community/u-m-faculty/science-communication-fellows.html">Science Communication Fellows</a> programs. I firmly believe in science popularization as a mean to improve diversity and inclusivity in science. In 2021, I inititaed and have since been organizing the (virtual) <a href="https://vllt-joint-seminar-series.github.io/2022/">VLLT Joint Seminar Series on Physics & Astrophysics</a>, geared towards students in Vietnam. I describe these activities further in <a href="{{ "/social" | absolute_url }}">SOCIAL</a>.</p>-->

                <!--<p>I was a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA) in Garching, Germany. There I have worked with <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~fabians/">Fabian Schmidt</a> on <a href="https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/26235/">Bayesian forward modeling of galaxy clustering</a> and its application to cosmological or astrophysical inference.-->
		<!--<p>I obtained my PhD through the <a href="https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/">IMPRS-astro program</a>, a partnership between the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen and astro institutes around Munich, in July 2020 amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.-->
        <!--We had to wait a few months to celebrate my graduation (hence the distance between people in the above picture). I stayed in Munich for another year and a half to wait for the pandemic to calm down and also to resolve some visa issues.</p>-->
