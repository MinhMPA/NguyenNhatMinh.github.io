*Is all dark matter cold?*  
*Is dark energy merely the vacuum energy and a constant in Einstein equation of general relativity?*  
*Does GR still describe gravity on cosmological scales?*  
*How did tiny initial fluctuations in the early Universe look like?*  
*How did galaxies, galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments form and evolve from those primordial seeds?*  
I am a cosmological modeler working at the interface of theory and observations, looking for hints to (hopefully!) answer the above questions.

My research combine perturbative approaches, i.e. perturbation theory (PT) and the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS), with novel statistics to build accurate and roburst forward models that yield optimal Bayesian inference and comparison of cosmological parameters and models.

In a work published on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/07/063">JCAP</a> and featured on <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1095991/hl202405">MPA research highlight</a>, we built a novel forward-modeling pipeline for field-level Bayesian inference (FBI), based on the EFTofLSS and Bayesian frameworks. FBI aims to infer the initial conditions of the Universe, i.e. the primordial density field, from the observed LSS field, i.e. the galaxy density field, while simultaneously inferring the parameters of the cosmological models. FBI guarantees optimal inference without information loss.

<!--The above flowchart depicts the process of how to connect early fluctuations to late-time 3D galaxy field observed by galaxy redshift surveys in the forward-modeling framework. The whole process involves quite a number of moving parts. Using N-body simulations as the reference, I have systematically investigated how each ingredient, including but not limited to gravity, galaxy bias model and likelihood (red blocks), affects the inferred initial conditions (first blue block). I demonstrate that the Fourier phase of initial conditions are robustly recovered well beyond the linear limit in quasi-linear regime. Further, I show that the bias model and likelihood for galaxy can significantly bias the inferred amplitude of initial conditions, which implies the same for inference of cosmological parameters. Alarmingly, none of the models I tested could avoid this bias. My findings underlie the demand for either a more rigorous physical model or a more flexible data-driven approach.-->

#### Measuring the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich while optimally account for cluster velocity uncertainty

As CMB photons traverse the Universe towards us and our telescopes, they encounter and scatter off free electrons inside cluster of galaxies along the line-of-sight (LOS). These scatterings leave tiny secondary anisotropiess on the CMB map.
The cartoon below illustrates such imprints, specifically the *kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect* (kSZ): the CMB photons appear to be Doppler-shifted towards either blue or red -- that is, hot or cold relatively to the primary CMB blackbody temperature -- depending on whether the cluster is moving away or towards the observer. At first order, for each individual galaxy cluster, the shift is linearly proportional to the product of cluster's LOS velocity and free electron abundance.
<p align="center">
 <span class=""><img src="{{ "images/kSZmap_WebSkylite.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" /></span></p> 

<p> I have developed a Bayesian framework to optimally extract the kSZ signal from cross-correlation between CMB and cluster velocity datasets. The framework, for the first time, consistenly accounts for uncertainty in large-scale velocity reconstruction. On two modest samples of maxBCG galaxy clusters with spectrocospic or photometric reshifts, I find evidence of the kSZ signal at more than 2-sigma level. The amount of free electrons hosted by these clusters is in agreement with the cosmic abundance. My findings are summarized in the figure on the right which shows the kSZ signal amplitude -- or, equivalently, the fraction of (free-)electrons-to-dark-matter -- as a function of cluster relative apparent size.</p>
<p>I further demonstrate that, without accounting for velocity uncertainty, one can bias their kSZ measurement by up to a factor of 2 (see e.g. figure 4 in the paper below).

#### Measuring and modeling galaxy shapes at the field level

The tidal field of large-scale structure tends to align with large-scale filaments. This has indeed been observed in both gravity-only and hydrodynamics cosmological simulations, e.g. the HORIZON-AGN shown in the figure below, taken from Codis et al. 2015.
<p align="center">
<span><img src="{{ "/images/IA_tidal_filament.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="Tidal_field_filament_alignment" width="100%" height="100%"/></span></p>  

As galaxies form along these filaments, they are streched or squeezed by the tidal force, hence the *intrinsic alignment* between galaxy ellipticity (shape) with the tidal field (host filament).
We are the first to measure the amplitude of this intrinsic alignment at the field level, i.e. galaxy by galaxy, in observational data.
Specifically, using an inferred tidal field of Cold Dark Matter (which cannot be observed directly), and the measured shapes of luminous red galaxies within the same volume, we detect an alignment signal at more than 4-sigma level. Our findings align with the galaxy intrinsic alignment picture described above: at linear order, there exists a clear correlation between the LSS tidal field and the galaxy shape, whose amplitude is constant on very large scales, up to 80-100 Mpc/h.

<!--<p>My follow-up project involves developing field-level model of galaxy intrinsic shapes as biased tracers of the LSS tidal field and initial conditions. This will unlock the potential of (intrinsic) shapes as a novel probe of cosmological parameters. I choose the EFTofLSS approach for data modeling and the <a href="https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/leftfield">LEFTfield framework</a> for code implementation. The latter is going to be publicly released <a href="https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/leftfield/release">here</a> on GitLab once ready.-->
