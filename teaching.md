To me, mentoring and teaching are giving students an equal opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their backgrounds and starting points.

## Mentoring
I adopt an effective, personalized approach to mentoring and advising students.

## Teaching
I am continously refining my teaching approach to provide students an inclusive and active learning experience.
