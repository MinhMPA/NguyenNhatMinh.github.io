To me, mentoring and teaching are giving students an equal opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their backgrounds and starting points.

## Mentoring
I adopt an effective, personalized approach to mentoring and advising students. My aim is to let my students cultivate their own scientific interests and support each student to grow to their full potential in both research excellence and engagement across their domains of interest. My students have been recognized by awards such as the 2024 Origins PhD awards for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c0smicstring/">Andrija Kosti&#263;</a> (junior ML scientist at DeepL) and the 2024 Otho Lyle Tiffany & Mary Lois Tiffany Fellowship for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andhope/">Andrew Hope</a> (sophomore at UM Physics).

## Teaching
I am continously refining my teaching approach to provide students an inclusive and active learning experience. I taught an astronomy and cosmology course for motivated high school students at Michigan Math and Science Scholars, <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mmss/astronomy/">``Climbing the Distance Ladder to the Big Bang: How Astronomers Survey the Universe''</a>. The course encouraged students to climb the ladder of higher education esp. for astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology and received overwhelmingly positive responses.
