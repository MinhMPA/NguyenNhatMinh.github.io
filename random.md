Here is a (heavily biased!) list of random things I would recommend. I hope you find some useful suggestion(s) below.

## Textbooks

- Dragan Huterer's book, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-course-in-cosmology/3D74B59DC8D6219D079F777DFD3FB1DE#overview">A Course in Cosmology: From Theory to Practice</a>, provides the perfect balance (and connection) between theory and observation. If you are an undergrad or first-year grad student, I think this is a great starting point.

- Scott Dodelson's and Fabian Schmidt's <a href="https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog/record/990182621100106381">Modern Cosmology (2nd edition)</a> discusses both theories of CMB and LSS, and how to connect them to observation. The treatment of perturbations, starting from Bolztmann equations, is extremely comprehensive.

## Online lectures

### Cosmic Microwave Background

- Eiichiro Komatsu's course on CMB within the IMPRS program 2020 can be found <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/lectures--reviews.html">here</a>. It provides an excellent starting point. Much more useful CMB materials on CMB can also be found on the same page.

- Wayne Hu's <a href="http://background.uchicago.edu/">tutorials</a> on CMB and references therein is also a super helpful source to gain intuitions and excellent insights on physics of the CMB.

### Large-scale structure

- Fabian's <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0mOf556IcEu03Et4HX7fk3fjj9ZdJLC">lecture</a> at the IV Joint ICTP-Trieste/ICTP-SAIFR School on Cosmology 2021 should provide just enough background about the formation of large-scale structure, covering both perturbation theory and N-body simulations.

### Cosmology from large-scale structure

- Dragan's <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0mOf556IcE_cdSNjQIKlnJ_08QwA1Mr">lecture</a> at the IV Joint ICTP-Trieste/ICTP-SAIFR School on Cosmology 2021 presents a very hands-on approach that will be super useful for students who are already familiar with python and jupyter.

## Review articles

### Cosmology from large-scale structure and galaxy redshift surveys

- Donghui Jeong's <a href="https://www.personal.psu.edu/duj13/">PhD thesis</a> provides a succint account that helped me out tremendously when I first started as a PhD student.

- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0112551">Bernardeau et al. 2001</a> provides a very extensive review of LSS in the context of perturbation theory.

- Everything we know about galaxy bias (up to 2016-2019) was covered by this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09787">review</a> by Vincent, Donghui and Fabian.

### Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

- Physics behind the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect was discussed thoroughly in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808050">review</a> by M. Birkinshaw.

### Bayesian sampling methods

- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling: Half of HMC practitioners learned HMC from Neal's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1901">article</a>, the other half learned from Betancourt's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434">article</a>.

- Slice sampling: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0009028">this article</a>, in Neal's words, was "written for statisticians, but of interest to physicists who use Monte Carlo methods".

## Code

- <a href="https://www.dask.org/">Dask</a> provides a straightforward way to scale up your python implementation to handle big datasets while giving you a lot of control.
- <a href="https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">CosmoSIS</a> is a framework to analyze Weak Lensing survey data. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/MinhMPA/cosmosis/blob/40d41e4e8d6d64d5eebd4eea5f23f93d01ce69d6/CosmoSIS_installation-and-execution.md">manual installation guide for new developers</a>.

## General advice on doing research

I wholeheartedly recommend the following articles, which were suggested to me and all MPA PhD students by Eiichiro:

- Steven Weinberg's Nature article, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/426389a">"Four golden lessons"</a>.
- Martin's Schwartz's essay, <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research">The importance of stupidity in scientific research</a>

## Activities

### Ann Arbor

- Kayak (along the Huron river)
- Ice skate (any lake during winter)
- Watch our football team play at the Michigan stadium

### Munich

- Christmas markets (of course!)
- Parks: Englischen Garten, Olympiapark (esp. during the cherry blossom or festival seasons), Luitpoldpark (next to Olympiapark, you can see the Alps from the top of the hill)
- Museums on Sundays
- Beer gardens: Hirschgarten or SEEHAUS in Englischen Garten
- Gelato: Der verr&uuml;ckte Eismacher - im Wunderland (they have beer and obatzda flavors!), True & 12
- P&acirc;tisserie and/or chocolaterie: Widmann, Tanpopo, Andreas Muschler (in Freising not Munich, but it is worth it!)
- Billiards: Q-Billard
