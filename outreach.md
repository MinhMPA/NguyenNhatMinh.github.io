## VLLT Joint Seminar Series on Physics & Astronomy

<p>The idea started during the pandemic, when all seminars moved to the virtual format hosted on e.g. Zoom.</p>
<p>I put together a group of Vietnamese junior postdocs and graduate students in Physics and Astrophysics to organize this series of virtual talks in <a href="https://vllt-joint-seminar-series.github.io/2021/">2021</a> and <a href="https://vllt-joint-seminar-series.github.io/2022/">2022</a> for undergraduate and early graduate students in Vietnam, hoping to expose them to state-of-the-art scientific research in Physics and Astronomy. The kind of exposure I wish I had during my undergraduate days.</p>
<p>We have had many young international and Vietnamese researchers as our speakers. And we plan to continue doing so.</p>

## Science Communication Fellows

As a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/u-m-community/u-m-faculty/science-communication-fellows.html">Science Communication Fellows</a> at UM Museum of Natural History, I perform science demonstrations during their <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/visitors/things-to-do/scientist-spotlight.html">Scientist Spotlight</a> and science presentations during their <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh/visitors/museumathome/expert-expo/science-forum.html">Science Forum</a> events. More images and recordings are coming in Dec 2023 - Jan 2024. Stay tuned!

## Cosmology from Home - Ask-Me-Anything

I really like CfH and love their outreach component. At each CfH conference, they would have an Ask-Me-Anything session, hosted on Reddit r/askscience.

Here is the CfH2023 session where others and I answered questions from the public about cosmology, including the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14zdckv/askscience_ama_series_we_are_cosmologists_experts/">r/askscience thread</a> and the Youtube recording.

## Skype a Scientist

 <span class="image right"><img src="{{ "images/Skype_a_Scientist.jpg" | absolute_url }}" style="float:right;" alt="" /></span> 
Skype a Scientist is a non-profit, international program, that connects science classrooms to active researchers. Through informal interviews and conversations, the students get to learn more about science, scientific research and what it is like to work as a scientist. If you are either a scientist or a science teacher, I strongly encourage you to consider <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/sign-up.html">signing up</a>.

## Physicists To-Go

This is similar to Skype a Scientist, but managed by the American Physical Society (APS). It is my understanding that it is currently limited to within the US.
