## LCTP Social Coffee Hour (Monday, 4pm @ Randall 3444)

<p>Two of my favorite things at work are coffee and conversations. I really enjoy drinking coffee while listening to others' works, perhaps even more than telling people about my own.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics (LCTP), we have a lot of graduate students, postdocs and faculties who work on either High Energy Physics (HEP) or Astrophysics and Cosmology. It could be one of the long COVID symptomps, but I noticed that HEP people and astro/cosmo people do not cross-talk very often.
So I organized a ``platform`` for those conversations, disguised as something (I hope) most researchers love as much as I am: a social coffee with brownies and cookies.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kind support from the UM Physics Department, we have been going strong since Spring 2022.</p>

## Cosmology Student-Postdoc Journal Club (Wednesday, 1pm @ Randall 3246)

<p>This is, strictly speaking, not a social activities. But we do enjoy sharing (free!) lunch and daily life stories while also discussing papers and science.

<p>We are funded by the UM Physics Department.</p>

<p>I am an avid fan of: mechanical keyboards, role-playing board/video games and cue sports. I played in a <a href="https://bbv.billardarea.de/cms_leagues">Bavarian regional league </a> with my team at <a href="https://bsv-muenchen.de/">BSV M&uuml;nchen</a> when I was living in Munich.</p>
